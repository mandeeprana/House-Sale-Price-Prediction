# House-Sale-Price-Prediction

Abstract

The Great Recession was followed by a gush of economic prosperity that automatically put the market into recovery mode. However, following this phase, it hit a new low, where the real estate industry plummeted. Some of the reasons for this were global change and uncertainty, changing demand for homes, liquidity in the real â€“ estate capital markets, sustainability, and overvalued commercial properties.

In the pursuit to identify the reasons a home buyer would buy their dream house, other than just the banal reasons like the number of bedrooms, localities, or the amenities, we decided to explore the House Prices datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). The dataset proves that the sales prices for the real estate depends on a combination of various factors like street, alley, utilities, neighborhood, year built, roof style, garage, fireplace, etc. It would be helpful for the real estate agents to quote the price without underselling or overselling the property. In addition, our strategy would also assist the stakeholders determine what factors/amenities lead to increase or decrease in the house prices based on its significance. We intended to predict sales price by performing regression techniques, feature engineering, and descriptive analysis.
